These are my solutions for [[https://projecteuler.net/][Project Euler]] problems. I do not agree to follow
Project Euler's policy regarding not publishing solutions, I encourage other
people to publish their solutions online too. For leetcode solutions see [[https://git.sr.ht/~lr0/ps][/ps]]





/(The following progress bar is generated automatically using [[file:.github/p.py][this]] dummy python script and updated with every new commit using even more dummy git-hook. Skipped/missing problems are highlighted with yellow. Failed problems are marked with red. Non-solved problems are not highlighted. It only contains the first 400 problems for now, hopefully one day I will need to scratch this.)/
